# TermPDF
A simple PDF-viewer to be used inside a [compatible terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

It works by converting a PDF into images using PyMuPDF and displaying these images in the terminal using the graphics protocol.
A use case for this can be writing and displaying a LaTeX document side-by-side in a terminal multiplexer.
